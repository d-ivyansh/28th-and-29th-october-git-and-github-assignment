Working Directory=>{git add}=>Staging area=>{git commit}=>Repository
#working:- Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development
#staging area:- The Staging Area is when git starts tracking and saving changes that occur in files. These saved changes reflect in the .git directory. That is about it when it comes to the Staging Area. You tell git that I want to track these specific files, then git says okay and moves them from you Working Tree to the Staging Area and says “Cool, I know about this file in its entirety.” However, if you make any more additional changes after adding a file to the Staging Area, git will not know about those specific changes until you tell it to see them. You explicitly have to tell git to notice the edits in your files.
#repository:-The Local Repository is everything in your .git directory. Mainly what you will see in your Local Repository are all of your checkpoints or commits. It is the area that saves everything (so don’t delete it). That’s it. How do you add items from your Staging Area to your Local Repository? The git command git commit takes all changes in the Staging Area, wraps them together and puts them in your Local Repository. A commit is simply a checkpoint telling git to track all changes that have occurred up to this point using our last commit as a comparison. After committing, your Staging Area will be empty.
