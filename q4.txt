GitHub is a web-based platform that serves as a repository hosting service. It is primarily used for version control and collaboration on software development projects. Here's a brief overview of its key features:

1. Version Control: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in source code during software development. This allows multiple contributors to work on the same project simultaneously, making it easier to manage and merge their changes.

2. Collaboration: GitHub provides tools for collaboration among developers. It includes features like issue tracking, pull requests, and project boards, enabling teams to communicate, track tasks, and review each other's code.

3. Repositories: Projects on GitHub are organized into repositories, which can contain folders, files, and documentation. Each repository has its own version control history.

4. Web-based Interface: GitHub offers a user-friendly web interface for interacting with repositories, making it easy for developers to browse code, track issues, and collaborate without needing to use the command line.

Alternatives to GitHub include:

1. GitLab: Similar to GitHub, GitLab provides a web-based platform for managing Git repositories, offering features like continuous integration, code review, and issue tracking.

2. Bitbucket: Owned by Atlassian, Bitbucket supports both Git and Mercurial version control systems. It provides features such as pull requests, branching strategies, and integration with other Atlassian products.

3. SourceForge: An older platform, SourceForge, supports version control systems like Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. It also offers collaboration tools and project management features.

4. Azure DevOps: Microsoft's Azure DevOps provides a suite of tools for version control, build automation, release management, and more. It supports both Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC).

5. GitKraken: While not a hosting service like GitHub, GitKraken is a Git GUI client that facilitates version control and collaboration through an intuitive interface.
